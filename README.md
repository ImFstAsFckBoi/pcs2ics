# ics2pcs - Export PCS (procyclingstats.com) calendar search as an ics file

Small script i made because i couldn't find any good alternative.

## Usage
Run the main file and enter the URL of the  calendar search you want. Use the filters on the site until you're happy, then copy-paste the URL with search parameters.

```sh
> py main.py
URL: https://www.procyclingstats.com/races.php?s=<...>
FILE: <...>.ics
```

Now you can import the ics file to your calendar app.
